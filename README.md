# Sephora Product Recommender - IH Final
## by Danielle Steede

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based product recommender system tailored for the beauty industry. The recommender system utilizes customer ratings, "love" counts (or likes), and product prices to predict and suggest top products across various categories available in our store.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** We cleaned and preprocessed our customer data to extract essential features such as ratings, love counts, and product prices.
  
- **Machine Learning Model (Pasting Method):** We implemented a machine learning algorithm using the pasting method to predict and recommend products based on customer data.

## Benefits to Customers
- **Enhanced Shopping Experience:** Customers can quickly identify highly rated and favored products, especially during busy times and peak seasons.
  
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Shy customers benefit from personalized product recommendations tailored to their preferences and needs.

## Future Possibilities
- **Integration of Advanced Machine Learning Techniques:** Future iterations could explore advanced machine learning models beyond the pasting method, enhancing prediction accuracy and recommendation quality.
  
- **Real-time Updates:** Implementing real-time data updates to ensure recommendations reflect the latest customer preferences and trends.
